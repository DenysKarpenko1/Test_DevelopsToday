I implemented env variables resolving with runtimeConfig, since Nuxt recommend this approach in documentation: https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/runtime-config".

Getting Started

npm install - install all dependencies.
Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
